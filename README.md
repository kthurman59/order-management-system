## OMS service backend

Spring Boot service that exposes basic CRUD APIs for customers, products, and orders.

### Tech stack

* Spring Boot 3
* Spring Data JPA
* Postgres with Flyway migrations (dev)
* H2 in memory database (tests)
* Springdoc OpenAPI
* JUnit 5 and MockMvc for tests

### Profiles

* `dev`  
  Uses Postgres database `oms` and runs Flyway migrations in `src/main/resources/db/migration`.  
  Hibernate is configured with `ddl-auto=validate` so the schema must match the entities.

* `test`  
  Uses H2 in memory with schema generated by Hibernate.  
  Flyway does not run in this profile.

### Running tests

```bash
./mvnw clean test
